# RooMatch – Intelligent Roommate Matching Platform

**RooMatch** is a cloud-native web application designed to intelligently match roommates based on lifestyle compatibility, personal habits, and housing preferences. Built as part of a final-year B.Sc. in Information Systems project, it demonstrates scalable architecture, production-ready infrastructure, and end-to-end automation using modern DevOps and full-stack development practices.

## 🔍 Overview

RooMatch combines a dynamic single-page application with cloud-hosted services to deliver real-time, data-driven roommate recommendations. With a focus on modularity, scalability, and automation, the platform reflects best practices in microservices, CI/CD, and serverless architecture.

## 🛠️ DevOps Pipeline

The development workflow is fully automated using GitHub Actions:

1. **Code Push** → Triggers CI workflow
2. **Docker Build** → Creates containerized backend
3. **Cloud Storage Upload** → Updates static frontend files
4. **Cloud Run Deploy** → Rolls out new backend revisions

All deployments are zero-downtime with automatic rollback support.

## 🔭 Future Roadmap

* **Google OAuth 2.0**: Add secure, single-sign-on authentication
* **AI Matching Engine**: Integrate OpenAI embeddings + `pgvector` for smarter compatibility scoring
* **Push Notifications**: Use Firebase Cloud Messaging for real-time alerts
* **Mobile App**: Build a React Native client for iOS and Android
* **End-to-End Testing**: Integrate Jest and Cypress for automated test coverage
