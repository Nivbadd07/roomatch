# RooMatch 🏡

**RooMatch** is a cloud‑native web platform that matches compatible roommates, simplifies shared‑apartment logistics and elevates the co‑living experience, delivered as the capstone project for my B.Sc. in Information Systems.

## 🚀 Highlights

* Fully responsive single‑page interface built with vanilla **HTML / CSS / JavaScript** and Tailwind, optimised for desktop and mobile alike.
* Backend microservices: a \*\*Node.js\*\* (Express) API **and** a lightweight \*\*Python (Flask) match‑engine\*\* — both containerised and auto‑scaling on \*\*Google Cloud Run\*\*.
* Static assets and user‑generated media served from **Google Cloud Storage** with signed‑URL uploads for secure, direct‑from‑browser transfers.
* Persistent data stored in **Supabase (PostgreSQL)**; near‑real‑time collaboration enabled by native Postgres listen/notify via WebSockets.
* CI/CD pipeline built on **GitHub Actions** → **Cloud Build**, pushing images to Artifact Registry and promoting to staging / prod automatically on merge.
